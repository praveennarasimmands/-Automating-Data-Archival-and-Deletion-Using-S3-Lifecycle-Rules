# **Automating Data Archival and Deletion Using S3 Lifecycle Rules**

### **Problem Statement**

Organizations in various industries such as **Retail**, **Education**, and **Telecommunications** must manage data efficiently while controlling storage costs and meeting regulatory requirements. Storing large volumes of data, including product images, course materials, and telecom logs, can become expensive over time. Manual intervention for data archival or deletion is inefficient, and retention periods need to be strictly adhered to for compliance.

- **Retail**: Product images or promotional content should be automatically archived to **S3 Glacier** after a certain period of inactivity to reduce storage costs.
- **Education**: Outdated course materials and research documents need to be automatically deleted after a set retention period to comply with internal policies.
- **Telecommunications**: Call records and logs should be automatically deleted after reaching a compliance-based retention period to avoid unnecessary costs and maintain regulatory standards.

### **Solution Overview**

The project will implement **S3 Lifecycle Rules** to automate the archival or deletion of data based on retention periods, optimizing storage costs and ensuring regulatory compliance:
1. **Transition**: Move older, infrequently accessed data to **S3 Glacier** or **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**.
2. **Expiration**: Delete obsolete or expired data after the defined retention period.
3. **Integration with AWS Lambda**: Use Lambda functions for custom triggers (e.g., data processing) before archival or deletion.

## **Domains**

- **Retail**: Archive old product images to **S3 Glacier** and delete expired inventory data.
- **Education**: Automatically delete outdated course materials and research documents after a certain period.
- **Telecommunications**: Delete call logs or records after the compliance retention period.

## **How We Will Solve This**

1. **Create S3 Lifecycle Rules**: Define rules to transition data from **S3 Standard** to **S3 Glacier** or **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**, and delete data after a set retention period.
2. **Integrate with AWS Lambda (Optional)**: Set up Lambda functions to perform custom actions before data is transitioned or deleted (e.g., log data, send notifications).
3. **Monitor and report**: Track the status of lifecycle transitions and deletions through **AWS CloudWatch** logs and notifications.

## **Steps for Setting Up S3 Lifecycle Rules**

### **1. Install Required Dependencies**

Install **Boto3**, the AWS SDK for Python, which is needed to interact with S3 services.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### **2. Set Up S3 Lifecycle Policies**

#### **s3_lifecycle_policy.py**

Lifecycle policies will help transition and delete data based on predefined criteria.


### **3. Integrate with AWS Lambda (Optional)**

You can integrate Lambda functions to perform additional actions such as data processing before transitioning or deleting objects.

### **4. S3 Configuration**

#### **config/s3_config.py**

This file contains the configuration values such as bucket names, regions, and retention periods.


### **5. Logs**

Logs for lifecycle policy actions, including successful transitions and errors, are written to `logs/lifecycle_logs.txt`.

## **How to Use the Scripts**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/s3-lifecycle-project.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure AWS credentials** using the **AWS CLI** or by adding them to the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

4. **Configure your S3 bucket details** in `config/s3_config.py`.

5. **Create the lifecycle policy** by running:
   ```bash
   python s3_lifecycle_policy.py
   ```

6. **Optional**: If using Lambda for custom triggers, set up your Lambda function in the AWS Lambda console and link it to the S3 bucket event.

7. **Monitor lifecycle logs** in the `logs/lifecycle_logs.txt` file.

## **Conclusion**

This solution automates the management of S3 data through **Lifecycle Policies**, enabling businesses in **Retail**, **Education**, and **Telecommunications** to archive or delete data based on retention periods. By using **S3 Glacier**, **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**, and **S3 Lifecycle Rules**, organizations can minimize storage costs while ensuring compliance with data retention and deletion policies. Integration with **AWS Lambda** offers the flexibility to perform custom actions before data archival or deletion.
